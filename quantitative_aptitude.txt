** If two trains of length a metres and b metres are moving in opposite directions at u m/s and v m/s, then : The time taken by the trains to cross each other =	(a + b)/(u + v)	sec.

** If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time from points A and B towards each other and after crossing they take a and b sec in reaching B and A respectively, then : A's speed:B's speed 
= sqrt(b): sqrt(a)

**simple interest :-sum == principal amount .. both words are used 
	-compound interest :- final amount = initial amount * (1+r/100n)^nt
	-t = time , n = number of times in a year the amount is compounded

	-If a trader professes to sell his goods at cost price, but uses false weights, then

    Gain % = (error/(truevalue-error))*100

**percentage :-
	-If the price of a commodity increases by R%, then the reduction in consumption so as not to increase the expenditure is:
		- [R/(100+R)]*100

	-If A is R % greater than B then B is [R/(100+R)]*100 % smaller than A

	-If the price of a commodity decreases by R%, then the increase in consumption so as not to decrease the expenditure is:
		- [R/(100-R)]*100
	-If A is R % smaller than B then B is [R/(100-R)]*100 % greater than A

	-Let the population of a town be P now and suppose it increases at the rate of R% per annum, then:
		-population after n years = P(1+R/100)^n
		-population n years ago = p/[(1+r/100)^n]
		-for decreasing rate take -R

**calendar :-
	-odd days :  the number of days more than the complete weeks are called odd days.
		-if leap year than odd days = 2
		-else odd days  = 1;
		-if 1jan2005 = friday than in 1jan2020 day will be (friday+odd_days from 2005 to 2020)%7

	-leap year = divisible by 4,400 and not by 100
	-100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years
	-Number of odd days in 100 years = 5.
	Number of odd days in 200 years = (5 x 2)  3 odd days.
	Number of odd days in 300 years = (5 x 3)  1 odd day.
	Number of odd days in 400 years = (5 x 4 + 1)  0 odd day.

** numbers :-
	-(a + b + c)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
	-(a3 + b3) = (a + b)(a2 - ab + b2)
	-(a3 - b3) = (a - b)(a2 + ab + b2)
	-(a3 + b3 + c3 - 3abc) = (a + b + c)(a2 + b2 + c2 - ab - bc - ac)
		When a + b + c = 0, then a3 + b3 + c3 = 3abc.
	-(a+b)^3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3;
	(a-b)^3 = a3 - b3 - 3a2b + 3ab2;

	-To check if a number ‘p’ is prime, find a number ‘n’ such that ‘n’ is the smallest natural number which satisfies n2 >= p. Now, check if ‘p’ is divisible by any of the prime numbers less than or equal to ‘n’. If ‘p’ is NOT divisible by any such prime numbers, ‘p’ is a prime number. Otherwise, p is not a prime number.

	-(x^n – a^n) is divisible by (x – a) for all values of n.

	-Divisibility :- 2728 has alternating sum of digits 2 – 7 + 2 – 8 = -11. Since -11 is divisible by 11, so is 2728.
	Similarly, for 31415, the alternating sum of digits is 3 – 1 + 4 – 1 + 5 = 10. This is not divisible by 11

	-32675149 local value of 7 here is 70000 and face value = 7;

	-(x^n + 1) will be divisible by (x + 1) only when n is odd.

	-numbers divisible by 6 are in AP

	-factors of quadratic equation :- [-b+-sqrt(b2-4ac)]/2a

**HCF and LCM
	-H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Fractions:
		-H.C.F. = H.C.F. of Numerators/L.C.M. of Denominators
    	-L.C.M. = L.C.M. of Numerators/H.C.F. of Denominators

   	-Let N be the greatest number that will divide 1305, 4665 and 6905, leaving the same remainder in each case. Then sum of the digits in N is:
   		- N = H.C.F. of (4665 - 1305), (6905 - 4665) and (6905 - 1305) = H.C.F. of 3360, 2240 and 5600 = 1120.

   	-If hcf of two numbers = x then two numbers can be written as 
   		-ax and bx.

** surds : - 
	- (a/b)^x = (b/a)^-x

** boats and streams :-
	-If the speed of a boat in still water is u km/hr and the speed of the stream is v km/hr, then:
		-Speed downstream = (u + v) km/hr.
		-Speed upstream = (u - v) km/hr. 

	-If the speed downstream is 'a' km/hr and the speed upstream is 'b' km/hr, then:
		-Speed in still water =	(a + b)/2 km/hr
		-Rate of stream = (a - b)/2 km/hr.

** clock :- 5 min = 30 degree
	-if suppose 10.25 is the time
		- when converted to hours it is 125/12
		- so hour hand traces (125/12)*(30)
		- minute hand traces 25*6
		- diff between these traces is reflex angle

	-The two hands of a clock will be together between h and h+1 o' clock at
		(60/11)H minutes past H o' clock.
	-The two hands of a clock will be in the same straight line but not together between
		H and H+1
		-(5H-30)*(12/11) min past H if H > 6
		-(5H+30)*(12/11) min past H if H < 6
	-Between H and H+1 o' clock, the two hands of a clock are M minutes apart at
		-(5H+-M)*(12/11);
	-min hand and hour hand are at right angle for 22 times in 12 hours.
	-min hand and hour hand are at opposite direction for 11 times in 12 hours
	-min hand travels 6 deg per min
	-hour hand travels 0.5 per min
	-angle made by hour hand and minute hand at H hours and M minutes = 30*H-(11/2)*M

* lucky numbers

	-consider 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
	-delete every 2nd number 1,3,5,7,9
	-delete every 3rd number 1,3,7,9
	-so on infinitely , the numbers that don't get deleted are lucky
	-1,3,7,13,19....

* Find count of numbers which don't have 3 digit in them 
	-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-numbers-that-dont-contain-3/
	
* Magic square
	- sum of numbers in a row , column and diagonal is same
	- sum = (n*(n^2+1))/2
	- position of 1 is (n/2,n-1);
	- 
	1. The position of next number is calculated by decrementing row number of previous number by 1, and incrementing the column number of previous number by 1. At any time, if the calculated row position becomes -1, it will wrap around to n-1. Similarly, if the calculated column position becomes n, it will wrap around to 0.

	2. If the magic square already contains a number at the calculated position, calculated column position will be decremented by 2, and calculated row position will be incremented by 1.

	3. If the calculated row position is -1 & calculated column position is n, the new position would be: (0, n-2).

* find the next smallest number than "n" that is palindrome

	-case 1: 999 i.e n is palindrome and is in the form 10^x-1
	-case 2: 1221 palindrome even length 12321 odd length
	-case 3: 12345 not a palindrome and the first left digit from middle is less than first right digit 
				here 2 and 4
			12224 in this 1 and 4

* count trailing zeros of a factorial of number
	- number of pairs of(2,5) in prime factors = trailing zeros
	- number of 5's = n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ...

* find the next greater number from the given digits
	-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-next-greater-number-set-digits/
	-case 1:"4321" -> not possible
	-case 2:"1234" -> swap last two numbers
	-case 3:"534976" -> find from right side digit smaller than previous i.e 4 in this case
						then in right side find smallest number i.e 6 in this case
						swap 4 and 6
						sort digits right of 6 -> "536974"
						sort can be done here in O(n) because all other numbers except last are in descending order

* find the smallest number whose multiplication of digits is N
	-if n<10 ; ans = n+10
	-if n>10
	//9 is preferred over 3,3 and 8 over 2,4
		for(i=9;i>=1;i--)
		{
			while(n%i==0) store i in result array; n=n/i;
		}
		if(n>10) it has factor > 10 ; ans="not possible";

* 3*3 puzzle
	-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-instance-8-puzzle-solvable/
	-two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
	-idea behind is that even inversions remain even , even after some operations
	-odd remain odd
	-so inorder to get to 0 inversions initially inverions should be even

* Activity selection problem :- //https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/activity-selection-problem-greedy-algo-1/
	- sort according finish time 

* Huffman Coding :- //https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/
	-You can find Huffman Coding applied in compression algorithms like DEFLATE (used in PKZIP), JPEG, and MP3.

* k centers problem :- //https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-centers-problem-set-1-greedy-approximate-algorithm/
 	- NP hard problem
 	- optimal solution is obtained only if triangular inequality is followed (i.e distance between two nodes should be smaller than sum of distances through third point i.e x <= y+z)

* minimum number of platforms required for a railway or bus station
 	- merge sort

* protocols are set of instructions which make transfer of data possible in easy , reliable and secure way.
	-e.g if I call tamil guy and speak marathi he can hear voice but can't get what I am saying.

* physical layer deals with physical devices 
	-converts data in form of bits in frame to signals and signals to bits on other end.
	-multiplexing :- is a way of sending multiple signals over a communication link at same time in form of a complex  signal.
		-frequency division multiplexing :- in this method of multiplexing bandwidth is divided into subchannels.
		-wave-length division multiplexing :- multiple signals with different wavelength
	-receiver recovers all the signals by the method of demultiplexing.
	-encoding :- converting digital signal to analog or analog to digital.
		-manchester and differential manchester
	-repeaters,hubs

* topologies :-
	-mesh :- supports point to point communication , high reliability ,high security , high cost.
	-star :- supports point to point communication , hub,single point of failure(if hub fails) so no reliability.
	-bus :- no reliability and no security, single point of failure.[LAN]
			- multipoint connection so collision is there a lot.
	-ring :- same as bus but is unidirectional and uses ring tokens inorder to avoid collisions.
	-hybrid

* devices :-
	-cables :- hardware
		:- baseband - one signal at a time
		:- broadband - multiple signals at a time
	-repeaters :- hardware - regenerates the strength of the signal
	-hub :- hardware
	-bridges :- physical and datalink layer , hardware and software,table containing mac address and port number.
	-router :- network datalink and physical layer , uses IP address , has a routing table.

* circuit switching :- telephone(landline) networks[dedicated transmission path]
* packet switching :- data link and network layer , store and forward , uses routing table	
	- datagram switching - connections less,header for each packet 
	- virtual switching - connection oriented , header for only first packet.

* message switching :- hop by hop delivery,store and forward.

* attenuation :- is lowering of strength or enery of a signal.

* propagation delay is time taken by one bit to reach from point a to point b = propagation speed / links length

* transmission time :- is time taken to transmit all the bits i.e number of bits in packet.

* datalink layer :-
	- hop to hop delivery(node to node delivery).
	- flow control :- stop and wait , go back N , selective repeat.
	- error control :- crc(used in data link layer) , check sum(used in transport layer) , parity bits , hamming code
	- access control :- csma/cd , aloha and pure aloha
	- [framing]physical addressing (48 bit)

* error detection and correction :-
	- detection :- 
		-crc
		-checksum
		-simple parity check
		-2d parity check
	-correction 
		-hamming code //https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamming-code-in-computer-network/

* multiple access protocols :- 
	- random access protocols - aloha , pure aloha , slotted aloha , csma , csma/cd , csma/ca 
	- control access - polling , token passing
	- channelization protocols - fdma , tdma.

* pure aloha :- transmission can be started at any time , when collision occurs and sender does not receive ack it waits for some time and sends the data again.

* slotted aloha :- time is divided into slots of time = transmission time , station can start the transmission only at the start of slot.

* csma :- senses the presence of movement in the carrier medium , does not sense the entire medium just the point where it is connected to the medium.
	- 1 persistent , 0 persistent , p persistent.

* network layer :-
	-host to host delivery (source to destination delivery)
	-logical addressing [network address,host address]
	-routing - protocols - RIP , OSPF , BGP
	-fragmentation - dividing packets into smaller sizes.
	-congestion control - leaky bucket method , token bucket method , icmp ,igmp
	-devices - router , switches

* class full addressing [iana - internet assigned number authority]:-
	- class A - first bit = 0 , 2^31 addresses present
			  - 0 to 127 first octet
			  - 2^7 networks present
			  - default mask = 255.0.0.0	

	- class B - 10 first two bits , 2^30 addresses
			  - 128 to 191 first octet
			  - 2^16 networks present
			  - default mask = 255.255.0.0	- to get network address of given IP and the IP with default mask

	- class C - 110 first three bits , 2^29 addresses
			  - 192 to 223 first octet
			  - 2^21 networks present
			  - default mask = 255.255.255.0

 	- class d - 1110 fixed
 			  - 224 to 239
 			  - 2^28 addresses reserved for multicasting or broadcasting

 	- class e - 1111 fixed
 			  - 240 to 255
 			  - 2^28 reserved for military purpose

- class less [cidr - class less inter domain routing ] addressing :- 
	- notations - x.y.z.w/n - where n is mask or number of bits used to represent network/block
	- to get network address and ip with mask.
	- number of hosts = 2^(32-n);

- subnetting - dividing network into logical groups called subnets
			 - why ? -> management and maintenance becomes easy and convinient
			 - how to -> if network id = 200.10.20.0 , we have 255 addresses to divide into n subnets suppose n=2
			 then number of bits required to represent subnets = log(n) = log(2) = 1 so in the last octed if first bit is 0 it represent subnet 1 and if 1 it represent subnet 2.
			 -subnet mask is used to determine which subnet in the network.

* routing protocols :- 	routing protocols are used in order to maintain dynamic routing tables.
						intra domain :- 
							- rip(distance vector) :- sends only distance to only neighbours
							- ospf(link state) :- sends link state table to all nodes (flooding) , after dijkstra's algorithm is used to prepare routing table for all the nodes.

					   	inter domain :-
					   		- bgp (path vector)

* transport layer :- 
	- end to end delivery (port to port delivery)
	- tcp - reliability , connection oriented , inorder , full duplex
	- error control - checksum , end to end error control 
	- flow control
	- congestion control //https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-in-computer-networks/
	- segmentation :- adds seq no and port no to data.

* three way handshaking - syn , syn+ack , ack
	-Step 1 (SYN) : In the first step, client wants to establish a connection with server, so it sends a segment with SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) which informs server that client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with
	-Step 2 (SYN + ACK): Server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. Acknowledgement(ACK) signifies the response of segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with
	-Step 3 (ACK) : In the final part client acknowledges the response of server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer

* piggybacking - in piggybacking while sending data , acknowledgement is also sent through same segment.

* udp :- connection less , no order
	-e.g dns,dhcp,video streaming,broadcasting

* tcp vs udp :-

	- authorization
	- session restoration
	- session layer code is not provided by os it is there in the application that is being used.

* http vs https :- https://www.keycdn.com/blog/difference-between-http-and-https#:~:text=HTTP%20is%20unsecured%20while%20HTTPS,is%20signed%20by%20a%20CA.

* presentation layer :-
	- code conversion (ascii->ebcdic)

	- encryption/decryption
	- presentation layer code is not present in os it is provided by the application

* application layer :-
	- ftp
	- smtp
	- telnet
	- http
	- dns

* domain name system[application layer with http itself] :- maps domain names with ip address.
	- browser -> resolver -> root server -> (domain name extension)resolver -> authoritative server -> (ip)resolver
	- request goes from browser to resolver where domain name is resolved from right to left.
	- suppose youtube.com
	- first  we get authoritative server(where ip is present of domain name) location of .com from root server 
	- then we get ip from authoritative server.

	- local cache or dns resolver is provided by isp for frequently used sites so that request need not go to root server.
	-dns uses udp protocol

* voice over ip :-
	- is a method and group of technologies for delivery of voice communication and multimedia sessions over ip.

* check sum is basically a hash value that determines if the data sent  is perfectly accurate
sender sends checksum along with data in tcp header which is calculated again at receiver end if it happens to be different then there is an error.

* cookies is a small piece of data from a specific website stored in users computer 
	-functions like keeping track of users browsing activities - for advertising purpose
	-remembering login details
	-identifying your computer

* ipv4 vs ipv6 
	-IPv4 is 32-Bit IP address whereas IPv6 is a 128-Bit IP address.
	-IPv4 is a numeric addressing method whereas IPv6 is an alphanumeric addressing method.
	-IPv4 binary bits are separated by a dot(.) whereas IPv6 binary bits are separated by a colon(:).
	-ipv4 has checksum , ipv6 does not
	-ipv4 has broadcast , ipv6 does not
	-supports dynamic routing , supports static routing

* window size in sliding window protocols :-
	- (transmission time + 2 * propagation time)/transmission time

* every node has either red or black color.

* root is always black

* no two adjacent red nodes.

*Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendant NULL node has the same number of black nodes.

* comparison with avl :- The AVL trees are more balanced compared to Red-Black Trees, but they may cause more rotations during insertion and deletion. So if your application involves many frequent insertions and deletions, then Red Black trees should be preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is a more frequent operation, then AVL tree should be preferred over Red-Black Tree.

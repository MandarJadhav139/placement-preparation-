* segment is constructed using array
//video ref is segment trees by coding blocks 
//[41:00](build segment tree)time code is explained
//[1:17:00](query)
	- full binary tree
 	- it starts from index 1 of array which is root of tree
 	- followed by its children 2 and 3
 	- 2 has 4 and 5 , 3 has 6 and 7
 	- so basically if "i" is parent its children are "2i" and "2i+1";
 	- parent of ith element is "i/2"
 	- size of tree if n elements are present is 2n-1
 	- n leaf nodes and n-1 internal nodes
 	- but array size differs as there are many empty places in trees
 	- so array size is [2*(2^ceil(log2(n))] - 1 == approx [4*n + 1]

 	- segment tree construction O(n)
 	- range query O(logn)
 	- update O(logn)

theory :- 
	- subrange queries [search]
	- update queries.

* practical applications :-
	- to calculate strike rate from nth over to mth over in websites like crickbuzz
	- to calculate average speed from time x to y in a formula one race.
	- corona virus patients count in a certain specified region.

*** maximum size of array = 10^8
Maximum size of the array: We must be knowing that the maximum size of array declared inside the main function is of the order of 10^6 but if you declare array globally then you can declare its size upto 10^7.

	- if arr[i][j]=='x' then just check if it is top-leftmost x of the rectangle
	- increment whenever such x is found
	- total is answer

* In a "sorted" array if we have to find number of pairs with sum = 's' then consider 
	start = 0 and end = size-1;
	if(arr[start]+arr[end]==s)count++;
	else if(arr[start]+arr[end]>s)end--;
	else start++;

*************************************************
theory :-
- arrays have contiguous memory allocation
- direct access is possible in arrays
- collection of items of same datatype
- less lines of code.

- insertion and deletion dynamically is costly.
- allows fixed number of elements to be entered which is decided at time of declaration,unlike linked list.


- Linear Data Structure:
Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure. In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only. Linear data structures are easy to implement because computer memory is arranged in a linear way. Its examples are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.

Non-linear Data Structure:
Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.

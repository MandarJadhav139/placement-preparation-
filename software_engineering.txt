*what is software :- software is considered to be collection of executable codes , associated libraries and documentation.

*software engineering :- is an engineering branch associated with the development of software product using well - defined scientific principles , methods and procedures.

*need of software engineering :- The need of software engineering arises because of higher rate of change in user requirements and environment on which the software is working.
	- large software
	- scalability
	- cost
	- dynamic nature
	- quality management

*software development life cycle :-
	- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm#:~:text=SDLC%20is%20a%20process%20followed,and%20the%20overall%20development%20process.

* communication
  planning - estimating,scheduling,risk analysis
  modeling - analysis , design
  contruction - code and test
  deployment - delivery,support,feedback,maintenance,documentation

*sdlc methologies :-
	-waterfall model 
		- in this the software dev process is divided into different phases
		- output of one phase acts as input of the next phase
		- requirement analysis -> design -> implementation -> integration and testing -> deployment -> maintenance
		- disadvantage - not flexible , not for large and ongoing projects

	-v model
		- verification and validation
		- various means of testing at each phase in reverse order

	- iterative model 
		-cpmcd phases[communication,planning,modeling,construction,deployment]
		-one model created and deployed
		-customer feedback is taken and on that basis next iteration is performed.
		-iterations can be also performed parallely.
		-advantages - early delivery , more flexible
		-disadvantages - resources consumed are more , documentation is more 

	- spiral model
		-combination of waterfall model and iterative model
		-cpmcd
		-concept development , system development , system enhancement ,system maintenance
		-disadvantages - risk is not meeting schedule or budget.


	- agile :-
		-values - individuals and interactions over processes and tools
				- working software over comprehensive documentation
				- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
				- responding to change over following a plan

	- scrum (agile framework):-
		-sprint - after 1 or 2 or 3 weeks you deliver a product
		-product backlog,sprint backlog,increment
		-developement team is crossfunctional

- in agile model requirements are decomposed into many small parts which can be incrementally developed.Agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental models.
